# Temporal Scooter Rideshare Demo Frontend

**NOTE: This demo requires the API and backend to be running.
See the top-level README for information about how to start those. **

This is a playful browser-based demo that simulates a scooter rideshare 
experience with a 2D side-scrolling game interface. This demo showcases 
how Temporal-backed ride Workflows can be integrated into a modern web 
application.

## Features

- ðŸ›´ Interactive 2D side-scrolling scooter ride
- ðŸŽ® Simple controls (use â†’ arrow key to move)
- ðŸ“Š Live ride statistics (distance, time, cost)
- ðŸŽ¨ Parallax scrolling background
- ðŸŽ¯ Mock API integration ready for Temporal workflows

## Tech Stack

- React 18 + TypeScript
- Vite for fast development
- Phaser 3 for 2D game engine
- Zustand for state management
- Tailwind CSS + daisyUI for styling
- MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- pnpm (recommended) or npm

## API Integration

The demo includes a mock API that can be replaced with real endpoints. 
The API contract includes:

- `POST /ride/start` - Start a new ride
- `POST /ride/end` - End current ride
- `GET /ride/state` - Get current ride status
